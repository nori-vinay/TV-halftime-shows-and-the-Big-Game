# TV-halftime-shows-and-the-Big-Game
The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. In this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other.
## Dataset
The dataset used was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
## Analysis
<ul>
<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>
<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>
<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>
<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>
</ul>

## Conclusion

<p> Most non-band musicians do 1-3 songs per halftime show. It's important to note that the duration of the halftime show is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have. JT went off in 2018, wow. 11 songs! Diana Ross comes in second with 10 in her medley in 1996.</p>
